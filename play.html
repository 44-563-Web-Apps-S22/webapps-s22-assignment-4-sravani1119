    <h4>ACT I</h4>

       <b> SCENE I</b><br><br>
        Madame Pernelle and her servant--<span class="desc"> Flipote, Elmire, Mariane, Dorine, Damis, Cleante</span><br>

        <h6>PERNELLE</h6>
         Let's go, Flipote, let's go. I hate this place.
        <H6>Elmire.</H6>
        I can't keep up, you rush at such a pace.


        <h6>PERNELLE</h6>
        <span class="direction">[He begins to leave.]</span>
        <P>Peace, my dear, peace; come no farther.
        I don't wish to cause you any bother.</P>

        <h6>ELMIRE</h6>
        <P> What duty demands, I insist on giving.
        But, mother, what has caused your hasty leaving?</P>


        <h6>PERNELLE</h6>
        <p> I just can't stand the way your household runs . . .
        And no one cares what I wish to have done.
        Oh, yes, I leave your household quite dissatisfied
        For all my wise advice has been defied . . .
        And nobody respects me, and everybody shouts,
        And truly this is a home for the king of louts!
        Dorine. If . . .</p>

        <h6>PERNELLE</h6> 
        <p>You, my dearie, are a bold lassy,
        A little brazen and very sassy,
        You butt into everything to speak your mind.
        Damis.</p>
