    <P> What duty demands, I insist on giving.
    But, mother, what has caused your hasty leaving?</P>

    <p> I just can't stand the way your household runs . . .
    And no one cares what I wish to have done.
    Oh, yes, I leave your household quite dissatisfied
    For all my wise advice has been defied . . .
    And nobody respects me, and everybody shouts,
    And truly this is a home for the king of louts!
    Dorine. If . . .</p>

    A little brazen and very sassy,
    You butt into everything to speak your mind.
